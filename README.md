# -Scheduling-parallel-tasks
Scheduling parallel tasks based on data from parallel workload archives. The program determines the schedule with the smallest average flow time, equivalent to the minimum sum of task completion times, for a given set of tasks. To create this application, a greedy algorithm and a tabu search algorithm were employed.
